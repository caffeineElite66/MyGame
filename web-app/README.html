        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This app is written with Groovy on Grails. The front-end is power by jQuery-UI.
            Groovy is a loosely typed language that leverage the jvm. Grails is a groovy web framework
            that uses MVC pattern. jQuery-UI is a quick and lightweight javascript framework for
            designing UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app does not use any database for maintain state. It uses session to
            store everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            So...clearing your cache and cookies if something go wrong.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Pattern</h3>
        Besides the Grails framework is using MVC, i try to design the supporting
        domain objects as an Composition style pattern. The idea is to keep the business
        objects (AI, Game, Player...etc) away from the framework code. This way we are not
        tie to Grails. All business object can be extended and decorate with more detail
        implementation if needed. The Game object will be a composition of many smaller objects.

        <h3>AI Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            There are two algorithms used in this app. The <b>Random Strategy</b> and <b>Corner Strategy</b>.
            The <b>Random Strategy</b> AI make a move randomly if it's not taken.
            <br/><br/>
            The <b>corner Strategy</b>
            AI is something that I made up base on me losing at TicTacToe all the time. For the <b>Corner Strategy</b>
            the worst possible outcome for AI is a tie. You should not be able to beat it. If you can beat it you are either using
            the easy level, or I will buy every one in reddit some beer.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>The corner algorithm is as follow</h4>
        AI go first. <br/>
        Check for winning move for AI, take it if possible.<br/>
        Check for winning move for human, take it if possible.<br/>
        Check for a corner with no surround pieces around it, take it if possible, if not take any corner.<br/>
        Take a edge. <br/><br/>
        Human go first. <br/>
        If human take corner, AI take middle else use above algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm well aware that there are more conventional algorithms. I remember learning
        MinMax algorithm from school. I feel that my algorithm is much easier to follow
        and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
        The point to take away is that if you want to implement another strategy, all you
        have to do is to extend the <b>BaseAI</b> class.
    </p>

    <h3>Flow of The Game</h3>
    The flow is pretty simple. User select options for the game. We pass our responsibility
    to the <b>Process</b> Controller. Each time the <b>Process</b> controller check for winner
    or tie in the game. Then it prompt the player for next move.

    <h2>Front End Codes</h2>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/grails-app/views/game/options.gsp</b><br/>
        This gsp file contain the front-end code for human to select options for the game
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/grails-app/views/game/process.gsp</b><br/>
        This gsp file contain front-end code for displaying the game data such as
        game board, player moves....etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Back End Codes</h2>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_RROT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/Game.groovy</b><br/>
        This is the main Game Object which contain all the logic for game operation
        and creation of supporting objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_RROT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/Node.groovy</b><br/>
        This class define what is in a Node (slot in a board). I understand that
        I can easily use a HashMap to represent the The board and it's nodes, but
        for extendability I want to use a object to represent it. In the future, if
        we decided to implement MinMax strategy, we can extend this Node object to give
        it a goodness value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_RROT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/Player.groovy</b><br/>
        This is the base object for defining a player. Each player will have a
        value. Human will have a value of 3 and AI will have a value of 8. The reason
        why I use these value is so I can use math to do some simple condition checking.
        You can refer to the class document for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/ai/BaseAI.groovy</b><br/>
        This is the base class for the AI. This is the plugin point of the AI strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/ai/CornerStrategyAI.groovy</b><br/>
        This contain all operation logic of this AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/src/groovy/com/kl/tictactoe/ai/RandomStrategyAI.groovy</b><br/>
        This contain all operation logic of this AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/grails-app/controllers/com/kl/tictactoe/AITestController.groovy</b><br/>
        This is a prototype I use for a prove of concept for the CornerStrategyAI. You can still access
        this by going to ../MyGame/AITest/index
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/grails-app/controllers/com/kl/tictactoe/UITestController.groovy</b><br/>
        This is a prototype I use for a prove of concept for the UI. you can still access this
        by going to ../MyGame/UITest/index
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>__PROJECT_ROOT__/grails-app/controllers/com/kl/tictactoe/GameConroller.groovy</b><br/>
        This is the only framework code I have for this app. It's the main controller that delegate
        responsibility to each of the business code.
